1. First of all, I picked up only USD denominated crypto-currencies with "create_a_list_of_all_files.py". Output file is "usd-list.csv".

2. I created a summary of trading activities of the crypto-currencies in "usd-list.csv" with "create_a_summary_from_a_list2.py". Then I sorted by the trading volume. Output file is "usd-Summary3.csv".

3. I picked up top 20 liquid crypto-currencies, "top20usd.csv". I calculated daily returns of 20 currencies with "calc-returns.py". Output file is "returns.csv".

4. I calculated correlations between the 20 currencies excluding the last 1 year data with "correlations.py". Output file is "correlations.csv". All pairs show fairly high correlation coefficients, about 0.6.
